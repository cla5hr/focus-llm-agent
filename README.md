# CFD Case Copilot

**Turn a plain-English description of a flow problem into a validated, runnable
[OpenFOAM](https://www.openfoam.com/) case — meshed, quality-checked, solved, and
self-corrected, all driven by a local LLM agent.**

```

Setting up an OpenFOAM case means hand-editing a dozen finicky dictionary files
across `system/`, `constant/`, and `0/`. This project automates that with an
agent that is **grounded in OpenFOAM itself** — it doesn't just guess, it meshes
and runs the case and reacts to the real solver output.

---

## Why this design works (and why naive LLM approaches fail)

> **The LLM never writes OpenFOAM syntax.**

A 7B local model cannot reliably emit valid `blockMeshDict` / `fvSchemes` syntax —
that's why "ask the LLM to write the whole case" approaches fall apart. Here the
responsibilities are split:

| Step | Who does it | Why it's reliable |
|------|-------------|-------------------|
| Understand the request | **LLM** → fills a small JSON schema (`CaseSpec`) | LLMs are good at structured extraction |
| Produce dictionary files | **Deterministic Jinja2 templates** derived from real OpenFOAM v2412 tutorials | Syntactically correct *by construction* |
| Decide if it's correct | **OpenFOAM** (`blockMesh`, `checkMesh`, the solver) | Ground truth, not a guess |
| Fix failures | **Agent loop** reacts to OpenFOAM's own error messages | Closed-loop, evidence-based |

Every generated template in this repo has been **executed end-to-end on OpenFOAM
v2412** (see the integration tests).

```

The agent loop is implemented twice from the same node functions: a plain,
dependency-free orchestrator (`run_pipeline`) and an equivalent **LangGraph**
`StateGraph` (`build_graph`).

## Supported cases

| Case type | Physics | Solver | Example prompt |
|-----------|---------|--------|----------------|
| `cavity` | Lid-driven cavity, laminar, incompressible | `icoFoam` | *"lid-driven cavity at 1 m/s, nu 0.01"* |
| `channel` | 2D channel/duct, turbulent (RANS), incompressible | `simpleFoam` | *"turbulent channel flow at 10 m/s, k-omega SST, Re 50000"* |
| `forward_step` | Supersonic flow over a step, compressible | `rhoCentralFoam` | *"supersonic flow over a forward step at Mach 3"* |

`channel` supports `kOmegaSST` and `kEpsilon`. `forward_step` derives velocity from
a Mach number using the ideal-gas speed of sound and auto-sizes the time step from
the CFL condition.

## Quickstart (WSL / Linux)

### 0. Prerequisites
- OpenFOAM (tested on **v2412**, ESI/openfoam.com build) — source its `etc/bashrc`.
- [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) with the local models (optional — a rule-based
  parser works without it):
  ```bash
  ollama pull qwen2.5-coder:7b
  ollama pull nomic-embed-text
  ```

### 1. Install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cla5hr/cfd-copilot.git
cd cfd-copilot
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[agent,api,dev]"     # or: pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Check your environment
```bash
cfd-copilot doctor
```

### 3. Generate and run a case
```bash
# Full agent loop (mesh → check → solve), using the local LLM:
cfd-copilot run "supersonic flow over a forward step at Mach 3"

# Mesh + validate only (fast), deterministic parser (no Ollama needed):
cfd-copilot generate "lid-driven cavity at 2 m/s, nu 0.01" --no-llm

# Inspect what the agent understood, without writing files:
cfd-copilot spec "turbulent channel flow at 10 m/s, k-omega SST, Re 50000"
```

Open the result in ParaView:
```bash
paraview runs/<case_name>/<case_name>.foam
```

### 4. (Optional) Ask the OpenFOAM tutorials (RAG)
```bash
cfd-copilot build-rag        # indexes $FOAM_TUTORIALS with nomic-embed-text
cfd-copilot ask "How do I set a supersonic inlet boundary condition?"
```

### 5. (Optional) Web UI / API
```bash
streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py     # interactive UI
cfd-copilot serve                       # FastAPI at http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
```

## Example

```text
$ cfd-copilot run "supersonic flow over a forward step at Mach 3" --no-llm
✓ Interpreted as a 'forward_step' case (solver=rhoCentralFoam, U=1041.75 m/s,
  turbulence=laminar, Re~6.7e+07).
✓ Generated case at runs/forward_step_mach3_0
✓ Mesh valid (11120 cells, maxNonOrtho=0, maxSkewness≈0)
✓ rhoCentralFoam finished; last time/iter = 0.0115; final residuals: e=2.7e-16

```
cfd_copilot/
  schema.py      # CaseSpec: the LLM↔templates contract (Pydantic)
  llm.py         # NL → CaseSpec (Ollama structured output + rule-based fallback)
  templates/     # Jinja2 OpenFOAM dictionaries (from real v2412 tutorials)
  generator.py   # CaseSpec → on-disk case folder
  openfoam.py    # sources etc/bashrc, runs utilities safely
  validator.py   # blockMesh + checkMesh → structured ValidationReport
  runner.py      # solver → RunReport (residuals, convergence)
  agent.py       # the loop: extract→generate→validate→repair→run (+ LangGraph)
  rag.py         # FAISS index over tutorials (nomic-embed-text)
  cli.py / api.py

```

## Use FOCUS from Claude Desktop / Cursor (MCP)

FOCUS ships an [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server, so any MCP host can
set up and run OpenFOAM cases conversationally. The host LLM plays the role the
local Ollama model plays in the standalone app: it fills the structured tool
arguments and can act as the repair agent by reading solver logs and retrying.

```bash
pip install -e ".[mcp]"
```

Three tools -- setup, run, debug:

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `create_case` | Structured parameters -> generated case, meshed and quality-checked |
| `solve_case` | Runs the right solver; returns convergence + final residuals |
| `get_case_log` | Distilled OpenFOAM errors + log tail, for diagnosing failures |

Claude Desktop config (`claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "focus": { "command": "focus-mcp" }
  }
}
```

Cursor (`.cursor/mcp.json`) uses the same shape. If `focus-mcp` is installed in
a virtualenv, use its absolute path, e.g.
`"command": "/home/you/cfd-copilot/.venv/bin/focus-mcp"`.

Example conversation once connected:

> "Set up a lid-driven cavity at 2 m/s on a 100x100 mesh, run it for 1 second,
> and tell me if it converged."

The host will call `create_case`, then `solve_case`, and read back the
residuals -- and if the solve diverges, it can inspect `get_case_log` and retry
with a smaller time step.

## Tests

```bash
pytest -q
```

Unit tests run anywhere. The integration tests in
`tests/test_integration_openfoam.py` actually mesh and run the cases, and are
skipped automatically if OpenFOAM isn't on the machine.

## Configuration (env vars)

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` | `http://localhost:11434` | Ollama server |
| `CFD_CHAT_MODEL` | `qwen2.5-coder:7b` | spec extraction / RAG answers |
| `CFD_EMBED_MODEL` | `nomic-embed-text` | RAG embeddings |
| `FOAM_BASHRC` | auto-detected | OpenFOAM environment to source |
| `CFD_MAX_REPAIRS` | `3` | agent self-correction attempts |

## Roadmap

- More case types: external airfoil (snappyHexMesh from an STL), converging–diverging
  nozzle, backward-facing step, natural convection.
- Feed RAG snippets into spec extraction for richer, less common requests.
- Post-processing tools (forces/`Cp`, Mach contours) as agent tools via MCP.
- An eval set of prompts → expected case configurations to track regression.
