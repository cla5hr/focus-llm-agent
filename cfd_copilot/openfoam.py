"""Thin wrapper around OpenFOAM command-line utilities.

Handles the one thing that trips people up: making sure the OpenFOAM environment
(``etc/bashrc``) is sourced so the solvers and their shared libraries are found.
If OpenFOAM is already on ``PATH`` (e.g. you sourced it in your shell), commands
run directly; otherwise we auto-detect a ``bashrc`` and source it per command.
